This is a fork (update by a third party) for Anki 2.1 of Thomas TEMPÃ‰'s add-on for Anki 2.0 <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1591779596">Quantified Self add-on - export your review log - v0.2</a>.

I made some small changes so that it works on Anki 2.1.20 for me. I only tested if I get a file "RevisionHistory.csv". I didn't check if the exported data makes sense. In theory I might have introduced an error during my conversion. Let me know if it works for you.

For details see the  <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1591779596">original description</a>.

<b># bugs, errors, feedback</b>
Use this at your own risk. No updates are planned. 

Please do not use reviews for bug reports or support requests. I don't get notified of your reviews, and properly troubleshooting an issue through them is nearly impossible (formatting is limited and I can't reply multiple times). If you find a bug you can let me know on <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki__quantified_self_fork/issues" rel="nofollow">github</a> or via reddit (/u/ijgnord). Maybe it's a quick fix.
